      DEMOCRACY MORE
  .mission
    .h2
      We can build better democratic systems and culture through IT platforms.
    .h4
      Due to Korea’s hierarchy system, it can be challenging to communicate democratically in everyday life. Regular citizens may have great difficulty when trying to make positive changes to society. So Parti wants to make a more democratic life and culture. We do this by creating IT platforms and organising offline meetups.
